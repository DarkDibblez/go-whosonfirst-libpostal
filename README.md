# go-whosonfirst-libpostal

Go tools for working with libpostal (sometimes in the service of Who's On First)

## Install

```
make bin
```

## wof-libpostal-server

```
$> wof-libpostal-server -options

Usage of wof-libpostal-server:
  -gracehttp.log
	Enable logging. (default true)
  -host string
    	The hostname to listen for requests on (default "localhost")
  -pidfile string
    	   Where to write a PID file for wof-libpostal-server. If empty the PID file will be written to wof-libpostal-server.pid in the current directory
  -port int
    	The port number to listen for requests on (default 8080)
```

_Note you will need to install the underlying [libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal) C library yourself in order for `wof-libpostal-server` to work._

`wof-libpostal-server` exposes the following endpoints:

### Endpoints

#### GET /expand _?address=ADDRESS_

This endpoint accepts a single `address` parameter and expands it into one or more normalized forms suitable for geocoder queries.

```
curl -s -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/expand?address=475+Sansome+St+San+Francisco+CA' | python -mjson.tool
[
    "475 sansome saint san francisco california",
    "475 sansome saint san francisco ca",
    "475 sansome street san francisco california",
    "475 sansome street san francisco ca"
]
```

#### GET /parse _?address=ADDRESS_

This endpoint accepts a single `address` parameter and parses it in to its components.

```
curl -s -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/parse?address=475+Sansome+St+San+Francisco+CA' | python -mjson.tool
[
    {
        "label": "house_number",
        "value": "475"
    },
    {
        "label": "road",
        "value": "sansome st"
    },
    {
        "label": "city",
        "value": "san francisco"
    },
    {
        "label": "state",
        "value": "ca"
    }
]
```

#### GET /debug/vars

This endpoint exposes all the usual Go [expvar](https://golang.org/pkg/expvar/) debugging output along with the following additional properies:

* AvgParse
* AvgExpand
* ErrInput
* ErrRead
* ErrMarshal
* ReqExpand
* ReqParse
* SuccessExpand
* SuccessParse

_Note: This endpoint is only available from the machine the server is running on._

## wof-libpostal-crawl

```
$> wof-libpostal-crawl -options /path/to/whosonfirst-data-venue-us/data

Usage of wof-libpostal-crawl:
  -libpostal-host string
    		  The host for the libpostal endpoint
  -libpostal-port int
    		  The host for the libpostal port (default 8080)
  -output string
    	  Where to write output data (default "libpostal.csv")
  -processes int
    	     The number of concurrent processes to clone data with (default 16)
```

`wof-libpostal-crawl` traverses a directory containin Who's On First records and queries an instance of `wof-libpostal-server` with an address string derived from SimpleGeo (`sg:`) properties that can be used to populate `addr:` properties. For example, this:

```
./bin/wof-libpostal-crawl -libpostal-host localhost -processes 200 /usr/local/data/whosonfirst-data-venue-au/data/
parsed 697614 files in /usr/local/data/whosonfirst-data-venue-au/data/ in 314.434 seconds avg ttq: 836 ms
```

Produces a file that looks like this:

```
wof:id,sg:address,lp:results
336966001,343 Montague Rd West End QLD 4810,"[{""label"":""house_number"",""value"":""343""},{""label"":""road"",""value"":""montague rd""},{""label"":""city_district"",""value"":""west end""},{""label"":""state"",""value"":""qld""},{""label"":""postcode"",""value"":""4810""}]"
186121023,3/ 53 Smith St Kempsey NSW 2440,"[{""label"":""level"",""value"":""3""},{""label"":""house_number"",""value"":""/ 53""},{""label"":""road"",""value"":""smith st""},{""label"":""suburb"",""value"":""kempsey""},{""label"":""state"",""value"":""nsw""},{""label"":""postcode"",""value"":""2440""}]"
```

_As mentioned `wof-libpostal-crawl` is currently designed for use with Who's On First documents with specific SimpleGeo prefixed keys: `sg:address, sg:city, sg:province, sg:postcode`. It will eventually be adapted for other things._

## Performance and load testing

### wof-libpostal-server

This assumes the server running on a single-CPU m3.medium instance reading from a URLs file containing 1517965 addresses in California. There is also a URLs file with 18M addresses from most of SimpleGeo but that is 8GB and I got bored waiting for [siege](https://www.joedog.org/siege-home/) to it to load it in to memory...

_Note: These performance tests are for an earlier verion of `wof-libpostal-server` whose input was a JSON encoded POST body. Since that is no longer the case some of the errors and timings discussed below are no longer relevant._

```
siege -c 1000 -i -f urls-sm.txt
** SIEGE 3.0.5
** Preparing 1000 concurrent users for battle.
The server is now under siege..      done.
siege aborted due to excessive socket failure; you
can change the failure threshold in $HOME/.siegerc

Transactions:		      153686 hits
Availability:		       99.33 %
Elapsed time:		       92.96 secs
Data transferred:	       27.33 MB
Response time:		        0.10 secs
Transaction rate:	     1653.25 trans/sec
Throughput:		        0.29 MB/sec
Concurrency:		      160.53
Successful transactions:      153686
Failed transactions:	        1037
Longest transaction:	        1.32
Shortest transaction:	        0.00
```

And this is what it looks like on the server side of things (again the same m3.medium instance):

```
curl -s http://192.168.1.158:8080/debug/vars | python -mjson.tool | grep Parse

    "AvgParse": 0.14599639355493366,
    "ReqParse": 154723,
    "SuccessParse": 153686
```

Average time is in milliseconds. When we look at the difference between requests and successes we see:

```
curl -s http://192.168.1.158:8080/debug/vars | python -mjson.tool | grep Err
    "ErrMarshal": 0,
    "ErrRead": 0,
    "ErrUnmarshal": 1037,
```

So that means the error were a result of weird JSON being sent to the server. The discontinuity between `wof-libpostal-server` and `libpostal-rest` is largely that the latter doesnâ€™t any error checking when parsing JSON so it appears to be passing empty strings to libpostal.
